# 🧪 Selenium Automation Testing with Behave (BDD)

This project is a web automation testing framework built using **Selenium WebDriver** and **Python**. It follows the **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** approach using **Behave** and implements the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **BDD Framework**: Test scenarios are written in plain English (Gherkin).
* **Page Object Model (POM)**: Separation of UI locators from test logic.
* **Data-Driven Testing**: User credentials managed via a centralized `accounts.json` file.
* **Professional Reporting**: Integrated with **Allure Report** for interactive visual dashboards.
